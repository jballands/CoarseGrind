~-~- COARSEGRIND v0.1 README -~-~
---------------------------------


BEFORE USING COARSEGRIND, PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY!

This folder should have 4 files (including this readme):
1) coarsegrind
2) coarsegrind_easyinstall.sh
3) coarsegrind.py
4) README.txt

CoarseGrind was created by a Hokie, for other Hokies. This means that CoarseGrind
only works for Virginia Tech students. If you would like to implement a version of
CoarseGrind for your school, feel free to fork this repository. If you are a Hokie
and would like to contribute to CoarseGrind, feel free to submit a pull request.

You must have Python installed on your machine in order to use
CoarseGrind. For more information, visit:
python.org


~-~- DISCLAIMER -~-~

I am NOT responsible for whether or not you get into your class using this tool!
CoarseGrind can in no way guarantee that you will be added to your class! It can
only increase your chances! Use CoarseGrind at your own risk!

~-~- STARTING COARSEGRIND FOR THE FIRST TIME -~-~

(The asterisk (*) indicates that you only have to start at this point if you have
used CoarseGrind before.)

A) For hardcore Python developers or general nerds:
   
   Make sure that you have the BeautifulSoup, Mechanize, and Html5lib
   libraries installed on your machine (or simply run 'coarsegrind_easyinstall.sh').    
   Then, use the relevant file to start CoarseGrind. Enjoy!

B) For OSX and Linux users (you make my life easy):

   1) Double click the file named 'coarsegrind_easyinstall.sh'. This
      shell script will install all the files you need to run CoarseGrind.
      If the shell script prompts you for your password, type in the password
      to your computer and press 'Enter'. I promise I'm not hacking your
      computer! :)

   2*) Double click the file named 'coarsegrind' to start CoarseGrind.

   3) Good luck!

C) For Windows users (why?!):

   1) Under 'Start', search for 'Command Prompt', then press 'Enter'.

   2) Open the Windows Explorer and find the location that Python installed
      itself. This will usually be directly under your C:\ path.
      (i.e. C:\Python2.7\)

   3) Open the 'Scripts' folder and locate an executable named 'easy_install.exe'.

   4) Click on 'easy_install.exe', drag it into the Command Prompt, then release.

   5) Copy the line of text that the Command Prompt generated. Enter the following
      lines of text directly after the generated line:
      mechanize
      beautifulsoup4
      html5lib
      
      You may be asked for your password. If are you prompted, type in the
      password to your computer and press 'Enter'. I promise I'm not hacking
      your computer. :) Remember to paste the generated line of code immediately
      before you type each line.

   6*) Navigate Windows Explorer to the location of 'coarsegrind.py'.

   7) Type 'Python ' into the Command Prompt. Then, click and drag 'coarsegrind.py'
      into the Command Prompt. Press 'Enter'.

   8) Good luck!
